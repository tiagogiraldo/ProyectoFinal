# Final Project

As a final project for the SoyHenry bootcamp, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a team of talented students to develop a comprehensive intermediation marketplace between hotels and users using NextJS and NestJS. This full-stack application leverages the strengths of both frameworks to provide a seamless and efficient experience for users to search, book, and manage hotel reservations. The project's backend, built with NestJS, utilizes a robust API to handle CRUD operations, implement authentication and authorization, and integrate with a database to store and retrieve hotel information. Meanwhile, the frontend, built with NextJS, provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the platform, featuring responsive design, pagination, and filtering capabilities. Throughout the development process, our team applied best practices in software development, including testing, debugging, and code optimization, to ensure a high-quality and scalable application. I'm proud to have worked alongside my teammates to complete this project, which demonstrates our collective ability to design and implement a complex system that meets the needs of both hotels and users. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and collaboration in software development.
